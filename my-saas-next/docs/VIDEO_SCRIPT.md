# Video Walkthrough Script

## 90-Second Loom Video Script for Product Launch

**Purpose:** Convert viewers into buyers by showing instant value demonstration

**Format:** Screen recording with voiceover + webcam bubble

---

## 🎬 **Scene 1: Hook** (0:00-0:10)

**Visual:** You on camera, then quick cut to demo page

**Script:**
> "Hi, I'm Farhan. I spent 200 hours building enterprise SaaS features so you don't have to. Most boilerplates give you auth and Stripe... and that's it. Let me show you why this is different."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Speak with energy, friendly but confident
- Emphasize "200 hours" and "enterprise"
- Quick cut keeps attention

---

## 🎬 **Scene 2: The Problem** (0:10-0:25)

**Visual:** Split screen showing ShipFast landing page vs your product spec

**Script:**
> "You've seen those $249 boilerplates. They promise 'launch in a weekend.' But when you need multi-tenancy? AI with privacy controls? SOC 2 documentation? You're back to Square One, Googling for 3 weeks."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Slightly frustrated tone (relatable pain)
- Show competitor landing pages briefly (no bashing, just facts)

---

## 🎬 **Scene 3: The Solution - Feature Demo** (0:25-1:00)

**Visual:** Screen recording of demo page, clicking through features

**Script:**
> "Watch this. [CLICK Demo Page] This is LIVE code, not mockups.
> 
> **CEO Digest** [POINT] - AI reads your database every morning, creates executive summaries. Your CEO gets insights, not spreadsheets.
> 
> **AI Pre-Check** [CLICK, enter 30% discount] - See that? It rejected the discount because our SOP says max 20%. This prevents $10,000 mistakes before they happen.
> 
> **Internal RAG** [TYPE: 'What's our password policy?'] - It's answering from YOUR company docs, not ChatGPT. No hallucinations. GDPR-safe."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Speak WHILE clicking (not after) - keeps pace
- Each feature gets 8-10 seconds max
- Highlight business value, not tech specs

---

## 🎬 **Scene 4: Social Proof / Credibility** (1:00-1:15)

**Visual:** Quick montage:
1. VS Code showing `services/` folder (scroll through files quickly)
2. Playwright test results (green checkmarks)
3. SECURITY.md opened briefly

**Script:**
> "This isn't vaporware. [SHOW CODE] 30+ production services. [SHOW TESTS] E2E test coverage. [SHOW SECURITY.md] SOC 2 compliance docs included. Everything you'd build yourself... already done."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Fast cuts, 3-4 seconds per visual
- Overwhelming with proof (builds trust)

---

## 🎬 **Scene 5: CTA** (1:15-1:30)

**Visual:** Back to you on camera, then demo page URL overlay

**Script:**
> "Click the link below. Try the demo.No signup, no tricks. Spend 60 seconds and you'll see why developers are choosing this over 'basic' boilerplates. If you're building B2B SaaS, this saves you 2-3 months. See you inside."

**Delivery Notes:**
- Direct eye contact with camera
- Confident, not salesy
- End with friendly smile

## 📊 **Success Metrics to Track**

After posting video:
- **View Duration:** Target >60% average (54 seconds of 90)
- **CTR to Demo Link:** Target >10% of viewers click
