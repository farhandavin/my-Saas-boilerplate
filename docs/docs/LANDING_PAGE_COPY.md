## 2. THE PAIN (Why they need this)

### Building Enterprise SaaS is Exhausting.
You have a brilliant idea, but you're stuck writing the same boring code for 3 months:
*   ❌ Configure Auth & RBAC (Again...)
*   ❌ Wrestle with Stripe Webhooks & Tax calculations
*   ❌ Figure out AI streaming & rate limiting
*   ❌ Set up Multi-tenancy & Data isolation
*   ❌ Write 50+ API endpoints & DTOs

**By the time you're done, your competitor has already launched.**

## 3. THE SOLUTION (Value Prop)

### Meet Enterprise Business OS.
The only boilerplate defined by **4 Strategic Pillars** to ensure you are Market-Ready on day one.

#### 🧠 Pillar 1: AI Intelligence
*Don't just wrap OpenAI. Build a cognitive machine.*
*   **CEO Digest**: Auto-summarize daily business stats into actionable insights using Gemini/GPT-4.
*   **Internal RAG**: Chat with your PDFs and company documents securely.
*   **PII Privacy Layer**: Automatically mask emails/credit cards before they hit the AI API.

#### 🏗️ Pillar 2: B2B Infrastructure
*Sell to Big Corp with confidence.*
*   **Hybrid Multi-Tenancy**: Support Shared, Schema-based, AND Isolated Databases (Unique DB per client).
*   **Smart RBAC**: Granular permissions for Admins, Managers, and Staff.
*   **Audit Logs**: Full traceability of every user action. Mandatory for Enterprise deals.

#### 💳 Pillar 3: Monetization
*Get paid immediately.*
*   **Hybrid Billing**: Subscription (Flat fee) + Usage-based (Pay per AI Token) via Stripe.
*   **Dunning Management**: Auto-recover failed payments and lock access without deleting data.

#### 🛡️ Pillar 4: Operational Excellence
*Sleep well at night.*
*   **Graceful Degradation**: If AI fails, the app keeps running.
*   **Mass Schema Sync**: Push database updates to 100+ isolated tenant databases in one click.
*   **Data Residency**: Let clients choose "US-East" or "EU-West" specifically for compliance.

## 7. FAQ

**Q: Can I use this for client projects?**
A: Yes! With the Agency License, you can build and sell as many SaaS products as you want for your clients.

**Q: Is it really Multi-tenant?**
A: Yes. We support the hardest form of multi-tenancy: Database Isolation. You can literally spin up a separate database for a high-paying enterprise client automatically.

**Q: What if I don't want AI features?**
A: The AI module is decoupled. You can disable it in one line of code in `env.ts`.

**Q: Do I need to pay monthly fees to you?**
A: Never. You pay once, you own the code. You only pay your own infrastructure providers (Vercel, Neon, OpenAI, etc.).
