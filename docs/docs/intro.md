# Introduction

Welcome to the **SaaS Boilerplate v2.0** documentation.

This boilerplate is designed to save you months of development time. It follows the **Service-Repository Pattern** to ensure your codebase remains clean, scalable, and testable as your startup grows.

## Why this boilerplate?

* **Production Ready:** Not just a tutorial code. Includes error handling, security headers, and linting.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic is strictly separated from HTTP transport layers.
* **Modern Stack:** Node.js v18, React v18, Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Query v5.
