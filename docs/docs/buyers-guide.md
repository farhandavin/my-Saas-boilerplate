# Enterprise Business OS (BOS) Starter Kit

Welcome to the **Enterprise Business OS**, the most advanced Next.js SaaS Starter Kit designed for serious founders building B2B applications.

## 🚀 Executive Summary

Enterprise BOS is not just a template; it's a **production-ready foundation** that saves you 200+ hours of development time. Built with the modern "T3-like" stack (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, Drizzle), it comes pre-configured with the complex features enterprise clients demand: **Multi-tenancy**, **RBAC**, **Audit Logs**, and **AI Integration**.

### Why We Built This
Building a SaaS from scratch is painful. You spend weeks configuring Auth, Stripe, and Database schemas before writing a single line of your unique business logic. We solved that.
